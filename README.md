Hello This me,
Btw this only for learning,testing,and sync my github with git (usage PAT/Personal Acsses Token)

1.first installing git
2.after instal then configure git with username/email
  git config --global -> for all user in device
  git config --local  -> for local directory/project
   also there will be some value to set username/email like this :
   ex: git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
   ex: git config --global user.email "Your GitHub Email"

3.then get your own PAT here how to get it :
    go to profile>setting>Developer (there will be to create accses token)

4. try way witrh sample project/text
   
   a.git init to initialize git into project
   b.git add (. or folder/filename) => to select which folder would be selected to add
   c.gti commit -m "Massage or note or Branch"
   d.open your github then create new project ....
   e.then remote/try push with git here i usage :
     git push --set-upstream origin "Branch Name"
